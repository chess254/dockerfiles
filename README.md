# Dockerfiles

A collection of Dockerfiles for CodeSignal user code execution. Look at the `README` associated with each individual file to find information on a specific image.

## Creating or editing a Dockerfile

Run your Dockerfile through this linting tool to look for possible bugs or optimizations:

## Releasing new versions
Please follow [the rules of semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

### Updating the image itself:

1. Go to [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/?namespace=codesignal), and verify that the image you're updating has an automated build set up for it. The build you're looking for should have the following setup:
   * Docker Tag: `{\1}`
   * Source: `/^YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE\/(v[0-9.]+)$/`
   * Build Status: can be anything
   * Autobuild: enabled
   * Build caching: enabled
2. Create a new GitHub release tagged with docker image name and new version. It should match automated build source, i.e. be something like `YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE/IMAGE_VERSION`. For example:
   * `r/v5.1`
   * `java/v4.0.2`
3. Go back to Dockerhub, and verify that the build started successfully.
4. After the build is finished, verify that it was successful, and **make sure there are no errors in the logs**. Sometimes builds finish successfully even though the installation is not fully successful. For example, that's what happened to Swift image in [this](https://cloud.docker.com/u/codesignal/repository/registry-1.docker.io/codesignal/swift/builds/0ba57fcb-7639-448d-b00e-91b89c75765b) build.
   
### Updating image dependencies:

Check out [build dependencies](#build-tree) to figure out if the image you're updating has any dependencies. If it does:

1. Go to [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/?namespace=codesignal), and verify that all images that depend on the base image have automated builds set up. The build you're looking for should have the following setup:
   * Docker Tag: `{\1}`
   * Source: `/^based-on\/YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE\/(v[0-9.]+)$/`
   * Build Status: can be anything
   * Autobuild: enabled
   * Build caching: enabled
2. Create a new GitHub release tagged with docker image name and new version. It should match automated build source, i.e. be something like `based-on/YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE/IMAGE_VERSION`, where:
   * `YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE` refers to the base image you've already updated;
   * `IMAGE_VERSION` refers to the new version for the languages that is about to be updated. Therefore, make sure the version does not collide with the versions of any of the dependent languages that you are updating.

   For example:
      * `based-on/ubuntu-base/v5.0`: The images that are based on `ubuntu-base` will be updated and their new versions are `v5.0`
      * `based-on/java/v5.0`: The images that are based on `java` will be updated and their new versions are `v5.0`
3. For every dependent image, verify that the build started and finished successfully.
4. If one of the dependencies, in turn, has other dependencies, repeat these steps for the `UPDATED_IMAGE`. This should only happen if you update `ubuntu-base`.
